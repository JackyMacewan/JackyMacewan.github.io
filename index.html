                Hello, my name is Hang Ly, preferably Jacky. I major in General Computer Science stream and minor in Psychology. I'm in my last term for my Bachelor's Degree, hoping to graduate this spring.

            <p> 
                During my free time (or when I don't want to do any thinking), one of my favourites is building model kitsâ€”specifically model kits of mecha from the Gundam series and sometimes other series. 
                This section will show photos of some of the finest (and not so-fine) kits I have built. One of my resolutions for this year is to finish all my backlog before buying more. 
            </p>
