                    Hello, my name is Hang Ly, preferably Jacky. I major in General Computer Science stream and minor in Psychology. I'm in my last term for my Bachelor's Degree, hoping to graduate this spring. 
                    I started in Macewan in 2017, planning to major in biology then, but after taking a few classes, I switched to Computer Science during my second year. 
                </p>

                <p> 
                    During my free time (or when I don't want to do any thinking), one of my favourites is building model kitsâ€”specifically model kits of mecha from the Gundam series and sometimes other series. 
                    This section will show photos of some of the finest (and not so-fine) kits I have built. One of my resolutions for this year is to finish all my backlog before buying more. 
                </p>

                    Known fully as Mobile Suit Suit Gundam, the first episode from this series came in 1979. It tells epic tales of war, 
                    evolution, and, most importantly, giant mechas' actions.
